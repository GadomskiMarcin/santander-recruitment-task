# Santander Recruitment Task

### PIN = 5173
As this PIN is stored locally in code, there was no purpose to introduce any additional layer of security

## Styled Components

Styled-components is an advanced CSS-in-JS library for React that provides component-level style isolation.
It's a clean, efficient and scalable solution.
The style created in this project is simple, only the values that were repeated in the code or have the potential
to be repeated in the development of the application are extracted

## Vite
Vite is incredibly fast development server and rapid build times, leading to a highly efficient development workflow.
Its native ES modules support and excellent integration with React make it an ideal choice for modern web application development.

## No other libraries

The task did not require the use of more libraries.
During a meeting about this project, I was informed that a project I would potentially be involved in,
will only use pre-approved libraries.

## Security

At this level of application development, it is difficult to add further security elements.
I used only masking and lazy loading to emphasize the importance of security
